## Description

Sparked provides inline suggestions to help you adopt Sparkui design system units seamlessly. Instead of manually typing design system variables, the extension automatically suggests the appropriate Sparkui variables as you type.

This extension was built particularly for real world use. It focuses on developer ergonomics from the point of Sparkui. 

**Key Features:**
- **Inline Suggestions**: Automatically suggests Sparkui variables as you type
- **Direct Replacement**: Click or press Tab to replace your text with the design system variable
- **Smart Matching**: Works with various formats (px, rem-calc, colors, font weights, etc.)
- **Keyboard Shortcut**: Press `Shift+Tab` to trigger suggestions manually

Included are the pieces I personally get sick of typing, and boilerplate that is helpful to stub out quickly.
