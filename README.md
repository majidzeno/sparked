## Description

These snippets were built to supercharge a workflow in the most seamless manner possible.

This extension was built particularly for real world use. It focuses on developer ergonomics from the point of Sparkui. 

Included are the pieces I personally get sick of typing, and boilerplate that is helpful to stub out quickly.
